title: Cholesky Decomposition on SIMD
categories: CPP
description: CThis project implements Cholesky Decomposition in C++ using Arm Neon, Intel AVX-256 intrinsics and OpenMP. The purpose is to evaluate the advantage of running the algorithm on SIMD platforms and compare the differences in performance between architectures. (Part of a MSc thesis at University of Glasgow)
